Technology and gadgets are my passion! After spending most of my career in IT, I now spend my days reading tech news and blogging daily about what I find interesting. I try to transform the techspeak into something that ordinary non-tech folk can see a use for, and I just post about what I find really interesting that day.

My interests lean toward open source, green technology, security, privacy, amateur radio (ZS1OSS), alternative social networks, etc.

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=plastic&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

Although I've not coded for many years, I recently restarted again in 2021 with Python. Python has long been on my bucket list as a general programming language to learn, and I must say if you've learnt any other language previously, Python is not difficult to get going with. So as, and when, I need some utility to use, and it's not available elsewhere, I'll be doing that in Python. I started out with a GUI manager on LInux for Cloudflare WARP, and will see where I end up with Python.
